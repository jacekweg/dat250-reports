- Additional Map-reduce operation

### Why implemented Map-reduce operation in Experiment 2 is useful
Knowing the total quantity ordered for each item can help businesses manage their inventory more effectively. If certain items are ordered in large quantities frequently, businesses can ensure they stock up on those items to meet demand.

### Interpretation of the obtained collection
From the data, we can infer that fruits, especially oranges and apples, are in high demand. Carrots and chocolates have a moderate demand, while pears are less popular.

### Pending issues
I do not have any pending issues right now.
